# Purpose: PLot the fire time series and groups. A grid with 8 subplots
# (2 columns, 4 rows) is created where each row represent a different
# window. On the first column (left side), both daily and monthly time
# series are plotted on different scales. On the second column (right
# side), month groups are plotted using boxplots.
